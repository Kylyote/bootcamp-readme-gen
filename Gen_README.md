## Description

The original machine had a base-plate of prefabulated aluminite, surmounted by a malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two main spurving bearings were in a direct line with the pentametric fan. The latter consisted simply of six hydrocoptic marzlevanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar waneshaft that side fumbling was effectively prevented. The main winding was of the normal lotus-o-delta type placed in panendermic semi-bovoid slots in the stator, every seventh conductor being connected by a non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential girdlespring on the "up" end of the grammeters.

## Installation

- Receive your Turbo Encabulator in the mail.
- Greet the delivery driver, they are under paid and usually sour.
- Use a Forklift with post malleable encoder based differential bearings.
- The floor should be prepped with a drawn reciprocation dingle-arm. This will ensure sinusoidial operation of the capacitance flux magnetos.
- Bolt your new Turbo Encabulator to the floor with planar spaced helical magnesium trioxide penta-couple bolts.
- Supply the Turbo Encabulator with tri-axial power filtered through a dadoscope deecommutator.

## Usage

Your Turbo Encabulator can be used much like the previous Hydro Encabulator. But in this case the prefabulated aluminite has been replaced with quantum tunneled tritanium. This ensures smooth operation of the boro-penta-phosphate girdlespring. For all other uses, refer to Rockwell Automation's Retro Encabulator User Manual.
